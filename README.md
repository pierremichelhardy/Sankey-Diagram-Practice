# Sankey-Diagram-Practice

This is related to the project I did that is seen in the Cleaning Student Data repository (https://github.com/pierremichelhardy/Cleaning-Student-Data). The university has tasked us to create a disruptive business idea and provided student data for us to work with. Our group was assigned to create a service for the internal communications department of the unviersity responsible for converting bachelor students into master students as well. The student data is from the University of Maastricht (UM). 

This code was made quickly for a presentation that needed to be done for a project. It was also my practice for visualizing data by making a Sankey diagram out of the data. I wanted to showcase the journye of students through the "recruitment funnel" or some sort, from when they applied for a bachelor at UM to until they continued their stay at UM as a master student.

One can see the resulting viz in "Sankey with Extra Data.png".
